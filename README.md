5amcode proudly presents its first Laravel specific package - a wrapper for the Notion API!
This package will provide a simple and crisp way to access the various Notion API endpoints, query data
and manipulate entries.

### Important note!
This package is in an early stage and receives continuious improvements. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require fiveam-code/laravel-notion-api
```

Get your Notion API access token like explained in [their documentation](https://developers.notion.com/). 
It's also important to grant access to the integration within your Notion pages, which is described in Notions docs as well.

Add a new entry to your `.env` like the following:
```
NOTION_API_TOKEN="$YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

And you're ready to go!

## Usage
It's too early for a documentation, so we collected some working examples in our [Notion Workspace](https://www.notion.so/5amcode/Working-Examples-813998dab4244158b51ea3b25b420c60).

### Testing

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```
